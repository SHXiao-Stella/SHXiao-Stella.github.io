I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in the Department of Finance and Investment at the School of Business, Sun Yat-sen University.

My primary research focus revolves around systemic risk, specifically examining the impact of asset securitization on systemic risk, the ways in which banks evade regulation through cross-holding practices in securitization, and determining the optimal approach to banking bailouts during periods of systemic risk. Throughout my journey, I have acquired knowledge on the application of advanced machine learning techniques to address these practical challenges. Notably, I have developed a Predict-Gradient-Optimization framework and successfully applied it to the problem of optimizing bank bailouts. Through the utilization of neural networks, I have effectively elucidated the relationship between rescue strategies and their respective outcomes, employing a fixed-point system based on the extended E-N model and ensuring the differentiability of the objective function. In addition to my expertise in systemic risk, I also possess a keen interest in macroeconomic modeling.
