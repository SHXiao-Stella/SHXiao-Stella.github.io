I’m a Master Candidate in the Department of Finance and Investment at School of Business, Sun Yet-san University.

My primary research interests lie in systemic risk. I've researched how asset securitization causes systemic risk, how banks escape from the regulation by the cross-holding behavior of  securitization, and what is the optimal banking bailout when systemic risk happens. Helping me along the way, I've been learning how to apply recent techniques in machine learning to these practical problems. I have presented a Predict-Gradient-Optimization framework and have applied it to the problem of optimal bank bailout. By using neural networks, I open the black-box formed between the rescue vector and the rescue effect based on the fixed point system under the extended E-N model and make the objective function derivable. I also have interests in macroeconomic modeling and portfolio management.
